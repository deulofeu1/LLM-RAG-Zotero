# Zotero Literature Library Integration for External Knowledge Base using RAG and Ragflow

## Project Overview

This project integrates the Zotero literature library as an external knowledge base for machine learning models utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, implemented through Python and Ragflow. It offers a robust solution for managing academic references, enabling users to effectively leverage their Zotero libraries in various applications. Key features include free access, duplicate removal, incremental processing, and automatic synchronization.

## Features

- **Free Access**: The method is open-source and free to use, making it accessible for researchers and developers alike.

- **RAG Technology**: By employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation, the system enhances the performance of machine learning models by providing them with up-to-date and relevant external knowledge from the Zotero library.

- **Built with Ragflow**: This project utilizes Ragflow to facilitate seamless integration and management of the knowledge base, ensuring efficient data retrieval and processing.

- **Duplicate Removal**: The system intelligently identifies and removes duplicate entries in the Zotero library, ensuring a clean and efficient knowledge base.

- **Incremental Processing**: Users can add new references to their Zotero library, and the system will automatically update the knowledge base without requiring a complete refresh.

- **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes made in the Zotero library are automatically synced with the external knowledge base, keeping the data up-to-date.

- **Executable Application**: After configuration, the application can be run with a single click for ease of use.
